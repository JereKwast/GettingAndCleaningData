> tidy_data.txt is created by the run_analysis.R script and contains the columns listed below. The script provides the average measurement for the mean and standard deviation, for each subject and activity. All values are averages of the stated measurements. X,Y or Z are denoting the direction the measurement and are appeneded to the end of the proper column names.

> Please refer to the features_info.txt file of https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip for further information.
