# GettingAndCleaningData
Coursera Data Science Specialization - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R script builds and provides a summarized version of the phone movement data recorded and provided in the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip file. The script reads the measurements provided and returns the average values of Mean and Standard Deviation variables for each subject and activity type. The script requires the data.table and dplyr to be installed and also expects the current Working Directory to be the parent directory for the UCI HAR Dataset folder found in the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip file. 
The csv tidy_data.txt file is built by the script in the current Working Directory. 
For further information on the values returned in tidy_data.txt please refer to codebook.md
